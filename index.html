        <p><b><MARK>Java is a high-level</b>, class-based, 
           <b> object-oriented programming language</b></MARK> that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. 
            It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers<u> write once, run anywhere (WORA)</u>,
            [16] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.
            [17] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM)
            regardless of the underlying computer architecture. 
            The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification)
            that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages.</p>   
           
        <p><strong>Java gained popularity shortly after its release</strong>, and has been a <ins>very popular programming language since then</ins>.[18] 
            <em>Java was the third most popular programming language in 2022 according to GitHub</em>.[19]<br/>  
            Although still widely popular, there has been a gradual decline in use of Java in recent years with other languages using JVM gaining popularity.[20]</p>
