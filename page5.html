        and produced by Vijay Kiragandur under the banner of Hombale Films.</mark> It is the first installment in the KGF

        most expensive Kannada film at the time of its release.<i> In the film, Rocky, a high-ranking mercenary, working
        for a prominent gold mafia in Bombay, seeks power and wealth in order to fulfill his mother's promise.</i> Due to
        his high fame, the leaders of the gold mafia where he works hire him to assassinate Garuda, the son of the
        founder of Kolar Gold Fields.

        The film's development began in early 2015, after Neel finished writing the screenplay.[6] Filming began two
        years later, in January 2017. Most of the film is set in the Kolar Gold Fields and was filmed in locales such as
        Kolar, Mysore, and parts of North Karnataka. The film's production was completed in August 2018.[7] Bhuvan Gowda

        The Kannada version of KGF: Chapter 1 was released on 20 December 2018 and the dubbed versions in Telugu, Tamil,
        Malayalam and Hindi released the next day.[9] The film received positive reviews from critics and dialogues from
        the film became famous worldwide. Due to this, the film performed well commercially and collected ₹250 crore
        (equivalent to ₹334 crore or US$40 million in 2023) in its entire theatrical run, becoming the highest-grossing
        Kannada film until it was surpassed by its sequel. It turned out to be a cult hit.[10] At the 66th National Film
        Awards, the film won two awards for Stunt Choreography and Best Special Effects.[11] At the 66th Filmfare Awards
        South, the film won two awards from five nominations, including the award for Best Film and Best Actor for Yash.

       <b> Plot</b>
        Journalist Anand Ingalagi's book El Dorado, which detailed the events at the Kolar Gold Fields (KGF) between
        1951 and 2018, was banned by the Indian government, but a television news channel procures a copy and interviews
        him.

        <i>Government officials discovered gold ore in southern Mysore State in 1951. On the same day, Raja "Rocky"
        Krishnappa Bairya was born to a poor underage Shanti. Suryavardhan, one of the powerful dons and politicians of
        that time, who accompanied them, killed the officials and leases the land for 99 years under the pretext of
        running Narachi, a limestone mine, but secretly established K.G.F. and his crime syndicate. For looking after
        his empire, Suryavardhan appointed five associates: Kamal, son of Suryavardhan's late associate Bhargav, who
        looks after gold refinery in Varca; Rajendra Desai, who oversees the transportation of refined gold bars coming
        from the refinery; Andrews, who oversees the gold smuggling in the Western Coast; Guru Pandian, president of the
        in-government DYSS party who gave political influence to Suryavardhan; and Adheera, Suryavardhan's younger
        brother, known for his ruthlessness who headed the security at KGF. Suryavardhan suffers a stroke and appoints
        his elder son Garuda as the future heir of K.G.F. Suryavardhan expected Adheera to serve as his son's aide, but
        Adheera unsuccessfully attempts to assassinate Garuda. In turn, Garuda bombs Adheera's car and he is presumed
        dead. Suryavardhan's associates eye the riches of KGF and plan to assassinate Garuda.</i>

        <mark>Rocky arrives in Bombay as a ten-year-old on a quest for wealth and power as desired by his dying mother, and
        begins to work for Shetty, a gold smuggler and Andrews' underboss, who competes against a Dubai-based underworld
        don Inayat Khalil.</mark> Years later, he rises in ranks and oversees the arrival of 'African' gold bars to the Bombay
        coast. Rocky's influence begins to rival Shetty's own. Andrews', who notices this, offers him Bombay in return
        for assassinating Garuda. Rocky accepts the offer and heads to Bangalore; he meets Desai's daughter Reena and
        falls in love with her. This irritates Reena's fiancé Kamal, who immediately dislikes Rocky. A statue
        inauguration is organised for luring Garuda out of K.G.F. With the help of Desai, Andrews, Kamal and Andrews'
        secretary Daya, Rocky enters the party office with a smuggled pistol. But the attempt is averted even before it
        began when they are spotted by Garuda's bodyguards. Rocky witnesses the authority and power that Garuda
        commands. Seeing no other option to murder Garuda, Rocky journeys to K.G.F, killing a unit of Garuda's henchmen
        to enter. The workers in K.G.F, who were forcibly kidnapped, are subjected to inhumane conditions and treated as
        slaves. Rocky becomes one of them and although apathetic at first, he is moved by the cold-blooded murder of a
        mother and son by a guard. Rocky stealthily accesses the map of the mine in the maintenance room during a roll
        call and narrowly escapes death after a fellow slave sacrifices himself to save the lives of his wife and unborn
        child. Andrews, Kamal and Desai are misinformed about the incident and assume Rocky is killed.

        Rocky engages in a fight with an entire unit of twenty-three guards, killing each one of them to save a blind
        slave. With this act, Rocky emerges as a messiah in the slaves' eyes. He orders them to burn the guards' corpses
        to let Andrews' and his men know he is still alive via their informants, Kulkarni and Garuda's younger brother
        Virat. Garuda prepares to leave his residence to investigate the fire and missing guards. To avert this, Virat
        smothers Suryavardhan to death, in order to sidetrack Garuda, who rushes back home.

        Shaken by the recent bad turn of events, Garuda orders Maa Kaali's ritual to be rescheduled from the following
        week to the next day, planning to kill his father's allies as soon as the ritual is completed. The next day,
        Rocky heads unsuspected through a tunnel to the site where Garuda has decided to behead three slaves as
        offerings to the goddess, as Vanaram discovers that the third slave to be beheaded was found dead inside his
        prison cell. Upon Garuda's arrival and sacrifice of two slaves, a concealed Rocky, who had taken the third
        slave's place, emerges and beheads him. The ecstatic slaves accept Rocky as their leader.

        Ingalagi concludes that Rocky intentionally chose KGF as the location to assassinate Garuda, thereby inspiring
        an army of slaves to help him seize control. The narrator (Anand) indicates, however, that this is just the
        beginning. The news of Garuda's murder reaches Ramika Sen, the to-be prime minister of India. Adheera, who was
        presumed dead, hears the news of Garuda's death and plans to resurface so does Inayat Khalil. All others at the
        K.G.F including Desai, Kamal, Andrews, Daya, Khalil and Shetty, were overjoyed by hearing the news. As Vanaram
        orders his men to attack Rocky and his army, a gunshot is heard.</p>
